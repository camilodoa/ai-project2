Evaluation function for Q5:
  <We calculate a score based on a linear combination of a few features. This linear combination is generated by adding "hunger", which is derived by summing the reciprocal distances from all the available food, each with a discount factor of -0.4 to the nth power; subtracting "fear", which is calculated the same as hunger, but is based on the distances to ghosts (who are not scared), multiplied by a discount factor of 0.5 to the nth power; adding a random value from a very small unifrom distribution (0 to 0.5), to break ties arbitrarily; subtracting the amount of food left, squared; adding the score of the game; and subtracting the number of powerup capsules left, squared. Our function also makes pacman chase after ghosts who are scared, by incorporating scared ghosts into the hunger factor with a greater weight than food. Capsules are also favored over regular food when there's little food left.>
